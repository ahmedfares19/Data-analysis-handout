Recap
Variable Types
We have covered a lot up to this point! We started with identifying data types as either categorical or quantitative. We then learned, we could identify quantitative variables as either continuous or discrete. We also found we could identify categorical variables as either ordinal or nominal.

Categorical Variables
When analyzing categorical variables, we commonly just look at the count or percent of a group that falls into each level of a category. For example, if we had two levels of a dog category: lab and not lab. We might say, 32% of the dogs were lab (percent), or we might say 32 of the 100 dogs I saw were labs (count).

However, the 4 aspects associated with describing quantitative variables are not used to describe categorical variables.

Quantitative Variables
Then we learned there are four main aspects used to describe quantitative variables:

Measures of Center
Measures of Spread
Shape of the Distribution
Outliers
We looked at calculating measures of Center

Means
Medians
Modes
We also looked at calculating measures of Spread

Range
Interquartile Range
Standard Deviation
Variance
Calculating Variance
We saw that we could calculate the variance as:

\bold{\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2} 
n
1
?	  
i=1
?
n
?	 (x 
i
?	 ? 
x

 ) 
2
 

You will also see:

\bold{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2} 
n?1
1
?	  
i=1
?
n
?	 (x 
i
?	 ?

 )

The reason for this is beyond the scope of what we have covered thus far, but you can find an explanation here.

You can commonly find answers to your questions with a quick Google search. Now is a great time to get started with this practice! This answer should make more sense at the completion of this lesson.

Standard Deviation vs. Variance
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. In practice, you usually use the standard deviation rather than the variance. The reason for this is because the standard deviation shares the same units with our original data, while the variance has squared units.

Shape
We learned that the distribution of our data is frequently associated with one of the three shapes:

1. Right-skewed

2. Left-skewed

3. Symmetric (frequently normally distributed)

Depending on the shape associated with our dataset, certain measures of center or spread may be better for summarizing our dataset.

When we have data that follows a normal distribution, we can completely understand our dataset using the mean and standard deviation.

However, if our dataset is skewed, the 5 number summary (and measures of center associated with it) might be better to summarize our dataset.

Outliers
We learned that outliers have a larger influence on measures like the mean than on measures like the median. We learned that we should work with outliers on a situation by situation basis. Common techniques include:

1. At least note they exist and the impact on summary statistics.

2. If typo - remove or fix

3. Understand why they exist, and the impact on questions we are trying to answer about our data.

4. Reporting the 5 number summary values is often a better indication than measures like the mean and standard deviation when we have outliers.

5. Be careful in reporting. Know how to ask the right questions.

Histograms and Box Plots
We also looked at histograms and box plots to visualize our quantitative data. Identifying outliers and the shape associated with the distribution of our data are easier when using a visual as opposed to using summary statistics.
Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics
In this section, we learned about how Inferential Statistics differs from Descriptive Statistics.

Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics is about describing our collected data using the measures discussed throughout this lesson: measures of center, measures of spread, shape of our distribution, and outliers. We can also use plots of our data to gain a better understanding.

Inferential Statistics
Inferential Statistics is about using our collected data to draw conclusions to a larger population. Performing inferential statistics well requires that we take a sample that accurately represents our population of interest.

A common way to collect data is via a survey. However, surveys may be extremely biased depending on the types of questions that are asked, and the way the questions are asked. This is a topic you should think about when tackling the first project.

We looked at specific examples that allowed us to identify the

Population - our entire group of interest.
Parameter - numeric summary about a population
Sample - subset of the population
Statistic numeric summary about a sample
Looking Ahead
Though we will not be diving deep into inferential statistics within this course, you are now aware of the difference between these two avenues of statistics. If you have ever conducted a hypothesis test or built a confidence interval, you have performed inferential statistics. The way we perform inferential statistics is changing as technology evolves. Many career paths involving Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are aimed at using collected data to draw conclusions about entire populations at an individual level. It is an exciting to time to be a part of this space, and you are now well on your way to joining the other practitioners!
